# eSample Data Entry Spreadsheet

This spreadsheet is provided by Georgia EPD for use by labs to report drinking water sample microbial analysis results. 

The latest version can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/gaepdit/xl-ese/releases).

For assistance contact Sean Earley, Watershed Protection Branch. For technical support or to report errors with the spreadsheet, submit a request at the [GA EPD-IT support page](https://gaepd.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## Instructions

It is recommended that you save a new copy and rename the spreadsheet for each submission. If needed, a blank copy can be downloaded at the link above. After entering your data, do not send the spreadsheet to EPD. Instead use the "Export to XML" button to generate an XML file and send that to EPD. It is recommended to name the XML file with the same name as the spreadsheet for future reference.

## Security warnings

Upon downloading and opening the spreadsheet, one or more security warnings will be displayed in Excel.
