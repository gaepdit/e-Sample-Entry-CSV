# XL-ESE â€“ eSample Data Entry Spreadsheet and Submission File Generator

eSample Entry (ESE) is a proprietary application used by many state Drinking Water programs to accept the electronic submission of drinking water lab data. Users can enter the data directly into ESE or upload XML files. But XML files are hard to create by hand, so another application, SDWIS Lab to State (LTS), can be used to generate the XML files from a correctly formatted CSV file. But valid CSV files are hard to create by hand, so this project is an effort to simplify the generation of data files for use in LTS or ESE.

We have created a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with data validation rules applied and a tool to export the data as a valid file for submission. Because the spreadsheet uses VBA (macros) for some functionality, the user must enable content in the security warning displayed in Excel.

## Development

VBA code is exported to separate files using a Git pre-commit hook as described here:
[How to use Git hooks to version-control your Excel VBA code](https://www.xltrail.com/blog/auto-export-vba-commit-hook). To enable, follow these steps:

1. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/).

2. Install [oletools](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools) version 0.53.1 by running the following command:

    `pip install oletools==0.53.1`

3. Enable the Git pre-commit hook by running the following command:

    `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

VBA can also be exported manually using the `export-vba.bat` file.

Optional: [Git XL](https://www.xltrail.com/git-xl) can be installed to enable the git diff command to work with VBA code inside the Excel workbook.
