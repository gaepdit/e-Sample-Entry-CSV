## Instructions

It is recommended that you save a new copy and rename the spreadsheet for each submission. If needed, a blank copy can be downloaded at the link above. After entering your data, use the "Export to XML" button to generate an XML file and upload it to the [eSample Entry website](https://ese.gadrinkingwater.net/ese/). It is recommended to name the XML file with the same name as the spreadsheet for future reference. Please note that the filename cannot contain spaces.

## Security warnings

Upon downloading and opening the spreadsheet, one or more security warnings will be displayed in Excel.

If a security warning is shown stating that "Macros have been disabled," the embedded buttons on each sheet will not work until you click "Enable Content." This is required in order to export the XML file, but it is not required while entering lab data.

## Data entry

Some fields in the spreadsheet require that a selection be made from a drop-down list. The list can be accessed either by using the mouse or by hitting `Alt+DownArrow` on the keyboard.

Instructions for each column are provided below. Columns marked with a ‚òÖ are required. Columns marked with a ‚òÜ are conditionally required (depending on other entries/values). Columns marked with a üóè require that the value be selected from a pre-defined list.

- ‚òÖ **Lab Certification #** *(required)* - Enter the lab certification ID assigned to your lab by the state.

### Samples data entry

Information on each sample analyzed should be entered in the Samples worksheet.

- ‚òÖ **Lab Sample ID** *(required)* - Each sample must have a unique identifier assigned or used by the laboratory that cannot be repeated. Must not be longer than 20 characters.
