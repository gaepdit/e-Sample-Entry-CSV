## Instructions

It is recommended that you save a new copy and rename the spreadsheet for each submission. If needed, a blank copy can be downloaded at the link above. After entering your data, use the "Export to XML" button to generate an XML file and upload it to the [eSample Entry website](https://ese.gadrinkingwater.net/ese/). It is recommended to name the XML file with the same name as the spreadsheet for future reference. Please note that the filename cannot contain spaces.

## Security warnings

Upon downloading and opening the spreadsheet, one or more security warnings will be displayed in Excel.

![Screenshot showing security warning that macros have been disabled](img/macros-disabled-warning.png)

If a security warning is shown stating that "Macros have been disabled," the embedded buttons on each sheet will not work until you click "Enable Content." This is required in order to export the XML file, but it is not required while entering lab data.
