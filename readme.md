# e-Sample Entry CSV File Generator

e-Sample Entry (ESE) is a proprietary application used by the Georgia Drinking Water program (and others) to accept the electronic submission of drinking water lab data. Users can enter the data directly into ESE or upload XML files. Another application (SDWIS Lab to State) can generate the XML files from a correctly formatted CSV file, but creating a valid CSV file can be difficult. This project is an effort to simplify generation of CSV data files for use in ESE.
