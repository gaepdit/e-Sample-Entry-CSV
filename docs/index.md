## Instructions

It is recommended that you save a new copy and rename the spreadsheet for each submission. If needed, a blank copy can be downloaded at the link above. After entering your data, do not send the spreadsheet to EPD. Instead use the "Export to XML" button to generate an XML file and send that to EPD. It is recommended to name the XML file with the same name as the spreadsheet for future reference.
